Clustering: In clustering while making clusters unexpected structures, clusters and groupings may pop-up. So in Classification we have prior knowledge about the possible classes but in clustering we have no prior knowledge about how many clusters will be formed. 

K-Means: By selecting the K numbers of clusters the centroids recalculation is done with the help of "within cluster sum of squares" or WCSS, this process performed iteratively to get the number of clusters.
