Classification: Classification process classify the objects/data/values into one or more categories(or classes) according to their respective features and attributes. Classification is a classical Machine Learning problem which can be implemented in variety of fields. 

Support Vector Machine: SVM algorithm are based on two support vectors which help to determine a optimal decision boundary that can be further used to classify a newly added data to the data-set.
